NAME
       vncsession - start a VNC server

SYNOPSIS
       vncsession [-D] <username> <:display#>

DESCRIPTION
       vncsession  is used to start a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) desktop.  vncsession performs all the necessary steps to create a new user session, run Xvnc with appropriate op‐
       tions and starts a window manager on the VNC desktop.

       vncsession is rarely called directly and is normally started by the system service manager.

-D OPTION
       vncsession by default forks and detaches. If the -D option is used, it does not fork and detach. This option is provided for use with system service managers that require  ser‐
       vices to run in the foreground. This option is not intended for debugging in a login shell from a terminal or for running vncsession from a terminal as an ordinary user.

FILES
       Several VNC-related files are found in the directory $HOME/.config/tigervnc:

       /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults
              The  optional  system-wide  equivalent of $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.  If this file exists and defines options to be passed to Xvnc, they will be used as defaults for
              users. The user's $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config overrides settings configured in this file. The  overall  configuration  file  load  order  is:  this  file,  $HOME/.con‐
              fig/tigervnc/config, and then /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory.  None are required to exist.

       /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory
              The  optional  system-wide equivalent of $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.  If this file exists and defines options to be passed to Xvnc, they will override any of the same
              options defined in a user's $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.  This file offers a mechanism to establish some basic form of system-wide policy.  WARNING! There  is  nothing
              stopping users from constructing their own vncsession-like script that calls Xvnc directly to bypass any options defined in /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory. The
              overall configuration file load order is: /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults, $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config, and then this file. None are required to exist.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tigervnc/config
       $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config
              An  optional  server  config file wherein options to be passed to Xvnc are listed to avoid hard-coding them to the physical invocation. List options in this file one per
              line. For those requiring an argument, simply separate the option from the  argument  with  an  equal  sign,  for  example:  "geometry=2000x1200"  or  "securitytypes=vn‐
              cauth,tlsvnc". Options without an argument are simply listed as a single word, for example: "localhost" or "alwaysshared".

              The special option session can be used to control which session type will be started. This should match one of the files in /usr/share/xsessions. E.g. if there is a file
              called "gnome.desktop", then "session=gnome" would be set to use that session type.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tigervnc/passwd
       $HOME/.config/tigervnc/passwd
              The VNC password file.

       $XDG_STATE_HOME/tigervnc/Bhost:Bdisplay#.log
       $HOME/.local/state/tigervnc/Bhost:Bdisplay#.log
              The log file for Xvnc and the session.
